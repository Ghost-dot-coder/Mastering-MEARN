## MERN Stack Practice and Learning

This repository is where I’m learning and practicing the full MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

My goal is to build everything from basic examples to complete full-stack applications.

## What I'm Doing

- Learning each part of the MERN stack step-by-step
- Building small apps to understand concepts
- Working up to larger real-world projects

This is a personal learning space, so code may be messy or experimental.

## Status

Still in progress. More apps and improvements coming soon.
